problem statement:
-there are different shops and different product categories
-for each shop and for each catergory we want to predict their sales in the closest 16 days


sub-problem:
-predict the values for one shop and for one category

observations:
-it is easier to implement/solve/comprehend sub-problem than the main problem
-it we split the problem into sub-probelms it will require more computional power and will be slower
